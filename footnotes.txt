#To make NetFlow v9 and IPFIX template caching work, the decoder needs the exporter identity. That comes from recvfrom.

#So update each UDP capability _run method to pass exporter IP to its decoder.

#Example for NetFlow capability _run:
data, addr = await loop.sock_recvfrom(sock, 65535)
exporter_ip = addr[0]
flows = decode_netflow(data, exporter=exporter_ip)

#Same change for IPFIX and jFlow. This is required for correctness
